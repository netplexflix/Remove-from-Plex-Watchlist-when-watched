# üé¨ Plex Watchlist Cleaner üßπ

"Why are the movies and shows we watched still in our watch list? Can they not automatically be removed once we've watched them?"</br>
asked my spouse. Fair question.. Apparently Plex can only remove them if you watch them through Plex Movies or TV Shows. If you watch them through your own libraries they remain in watchlist.

This script automatically removes watched movies and/or TV shows from your Plex Watchlist.</br> 
Keep your watchlist clean and focused on content you haven't seen yet!
